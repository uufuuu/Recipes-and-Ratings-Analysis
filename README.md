## Introduction
## General Introduction
-The "Recipes and Ratings" dataset provides a comprehensive collection of information about recipes and user interactions with those recipes, based on the data collected from [food.com](https://www.food.com).
-It is split into two main CSV files.
-The "recipes" data set contained metadata about recipes, providing a complete snapshot pf the recipes and their attributes, making it essential for understanding what each recipe offers. It includes information like recipes names, preparation times, tags, nutritional content, number of steps, and user-contributed descriptions.
-The "interactions" data set captures user interactions with recipes, including ratings and reviews. The data links users to the recipes they reviewed, allowing for an analysis of trends in user feedback and recipe popularity.

The central question we are interested in is: **How average rating could be deterimined by key attributes of a recipe?**
-This question is important because it enables us to identify which recipe characteristics—such as preparation time, nutritional content, or number of preparation steps—are most predictive of user satisfaction. Such insights are valuable for culinary enthusiasts, food bloggers, and platforms like food.com to optimize recipes and improve user engagement.


## Dataset Details
The dataset includes:
- **Recipes**: Information such as ingredients, cooking time, and instructions.
- **Ratings**: User feedback on different recipes, providing insights into user preferences and recipe quality.

## Motivation
- We're interested in understanding people's decision-making process when it comes to rating recipes. 
- Specifically, we believe this dataset allows us to explore how individuals rate recipes based on their attributes and characteristics, including the complexity of recipes, the ingredients used, and other relevant factors. 

## Objective
- we aim to identify key attributes that make recipes healthier and more popular. 
- Our findings could then help food bloggers and restaurants develop recipes that align with these characteristics, ultimately making their new offering healthier and more popular.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python** with **Pandas** for data analysis.
- **Data visualization** to identify trends and correlations.
- **Statistical analysis** to interpret user ratings.

## Key Findings (placeholder)
- Trends in recipe types that tend to have higher ratings.
- Relationships between ingredients or cooking techniques and user satisfaction.
