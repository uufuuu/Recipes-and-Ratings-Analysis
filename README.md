## Project Overview
This project is part of the Practical Data Science Course portfolio, focusing on analyzing the "Recipes and Ratings" dataset. 

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- **Recipes**: Information such as ingredients, cooking time, and instructions.
- **Ratings**: User feedback on different recipes, providing insights into user preferences and recipe quality.

## Motivation
- We're interested in understanding people's decision-making process when it comes to rating recipes. 
- Specifically, we believe this dataset allows us to explore how individuals rate recipes based on their attributes and characteristics, including the complexity of recipes, the ingredients used, and other relevant factors. 

## Objective
- we aim to identify key attributes that make recipes healthier and more popular. 
- Our findings could then help food bloggers and restaurants develop recipes that align with these characteristics, ultimately making their new offering healthier and more popular.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python** with **Pandas** for data analysis.
- **Data visualization** to identify trends and correlations.
- **Statistical analysis** to interpret user ratings.

## Key Findings (placeholder)
- Trends in recipe types that tend to have higher ratings.
- Relationships between ingredients or cooking techniques and user satisfaction.
